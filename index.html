      <div class="s_info">
        <ul>
          <li>Very deep substrate</li>
          <li>Provide initial burrow buy digging out a hole. Tarantula will do the rest once it settles in the burrow</li>
          <li>Provide leaf litter, moss, other foliage for building a nest</li>
          <li>Tend to be "pet holes" that you rarely see especially as slings</li>
          <li>Tend to forage at night when it's dark and quiet</li>
        </ul>

      <div class = "s_photo"><img src = "fe.jpg"/></div>

      <div class = "s_info">
        <ul>
          <li>Still a good amount of substrate as they still burrow and use substrate for building</li>
          <li>More width than height in enclosure</li>
          <li>Generally at least 3x leg span width to walk around</li>
          <li>Lots of anchor points to web up including branches and foliage</li>
          <li>A burrow to retreat/hide in</li>
          <li>Important not to have more than a few inches from top to substrate as tarantulas are prone to fatal falls</li>
        </ul>

        <div class = "s_photo"><img src = "te.jpg"/></div>

        <div class = "s_info">
          <ul>
            <li>Vertical enclosure with few inches of substrate at the bottom</li>
            <li>Cork bark or other objects to climb and web up</li>
            <li>Some sort of vertical hide</li>
            <li>Enclosure that can open from the front is best as to not disturb webbing up top</li>
            <li>Water dish elevated off ground as they rarely spend time near the floor</li>
          </ul>

          <ul>
            <li>Most species will kick urticating hairs as a defense</li>
            <li>Generally more docile and less defensive</li>
            <li>Most species have non medically significant venom</li>
            <li>Seen as more beginner friendly</li>
            <li>Some species are seen as a stepping stone to old world as they have more potent venom ex: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psalmopoeus_cambridgei">P. Crambdigei</a></li>
          </ul>

          <ul>
            <li>Seen as the more advance species to keep</li>
            <li>Medically significant venom</li>
            <li>Extremeley fast and generally more defensive</li>
            <li>A lot of beautiful species not normally seen</li>

        <div class ="specimen_title">General knowledge for all species</div>
        <div class ="s_info">
          <ul>
            <li>Do not keep a sponge in the water dish. It serves no purpose as the tarantula can not draw water from it.</li>
            <li>Spot clean at most but generally you do not need to ever completely clean out an enclosure</li>
            <li>Do not repeatedly disturb the tarantula. Long lengths of time with out seeing the Tarantula are normal</li>
            <li>Any food not eaten should be removed after a day</li>
            <li>Tarantulas lay on their back during molt and molts last hours</li>
            <li>Keep water available through a water dish or misting their web</li>
            <li>Slings will generally burrow regardless of type</li>
            <li>Substrate should never be swampy</li>
            <li>Some species are known to go months to a year with out eating</li>
            <li>If the tarantula has access to water and it's abdomen isn't shrivelled it is generally doing fine</li>
            <li>Tarantulas don't eat for days to weeks after molting. The older they are the longer before their fangs harden after a molt</li>
          </ul>
