          <div class = "s_types"><p>What type of Tarantula do you have?<p>
          <div>
            <ul>
              <li>Fossorial</li>
              <li>Terrestrial</li>
              <li>Arboreal</li>
            </ul>

      </div>
      <div class = "specimen_title">Fossorial</div>
      <div class="s_info">
        <ul>
          <li>Very deep substrate</li>
          <li>Provide initial burrow buy digging out a hole. Tarantula will do the rest once it settles in the burrow</li>
          <li>Provide leaf litter, moss, other foliage for building a nest</li>
          <li>Tend to be "pet holes" that you rarely see especially as slings</li>
          <li>Tend to forage at night when it's dark and quiet</li>
        </ul>
      </div>
      <div class = "s_photo"><img src = "fe.jpg"/></div>
      <div class = "specimen_title">Terrestrial</div>
      <div class = "s_info">
        <ul>
          <li>Still a good amount of substrate as they still burrow and use substrate for building</li>
          <li>More width than height in enclosure</li>
          <li>Generally at least 3x leg span width to walk around</li>
          <li>Lots of anchor points to web up including branches and foliage</li>
          <li>A burrow to retreat/hide in</li>
          <li>Important not to have more than a few inches from top to substrate as tarantulas are prone to fatal falls</li>
        </ul>
        </div>
        <div class = "s_photo"><img src = "te.jpg"/></div>
        <div class = "specimen_title">Arboreal</div>
        <div class = "s_info">
          <ul>
            <li>Vertical enclosure with few inches of substrate at the bottom</li>
            <li>Cork bark or other objects to climb and web up</li>
            <li>Some sort of vertical hide</li>
            <li>Enclosure that can open from the front is best as to not disturb webbing up top</li>
            <li>Water dish elevated off ground as they rarely spend time near the floor</li>
          </ul>
