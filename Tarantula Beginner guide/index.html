    <h1>This page will walk you through all you need to know to find your perfect first tarantula</h1>

    <h2>We will go over almost every scenario in which a beginner might get their first tarantula so pick what applies to you or read them all if you are still unsure</h2>

    <!-The next sections will go over buying from store, breeder, or from friend->
  <div>
    <p>The most common way for beginners is a pet store. Many in the hobby will suggest against this for a few reasons we will discuss shortly. However many will either not know breeders online exist or are still skeptical about ordering a live creature
    from someone online. The best way ultimately is either from an online breeder or a local expo that will have tarantula shops. If you get a tarantula from a chain pet store they will mostly have a very small selection that they cycle through.</p>

       <h1>Where to purchase quick jump</h1>
          <ul>
            <li>Pet Store</li>
            <li>Expo</li>
            <li>Online Dealer</li>
          </ul>
     </div>
  <div>
    <h1>Chain pet store</h1>
    <p>The most common Tarantulas you will come across at pet stores are almost always going to be *new world*. Which all you need to know for now is that those are species that come from the Americas and mostly have non *medicaly significant* venom. *New world* are
      widely regarded as the beginner species for these reasons. Although some do have potent venom the ones you come across at a chain petstore most likely won't.</p>
      <br>
      <p>Here are a few Tarantulas that you can expect to find at a local chain pet store</p>
      <!- Include images of listed Tarantulas ->
      <ul>
        <li>Desert Blonde or Arizona Blonde</li>
        <li>Mexican fireleg</li>
        <li>Curly hair</li>
        <li>Pink toe</li>
      </ul>
      <p>As mentioned before these are all *new world* tarantulas. It means they are mostly docile and lack the danger of a *medically significant* bite.
